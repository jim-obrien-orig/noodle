# noodle
noodle is an open-source, context-oriented search engine for developers - by developers.

## why do developers need another search engine?
As a developer, how often do you search for solutions to problems, or how to do something you may have forgotten because you switch between a variety of programming languages and sdks?

Developers need to find information specific to the problem at hand, and the information needs to have deep informational content. Google and bing's search results are geared towards serving ads. Therefore there's a proliferation of single page sites with very limited content that just scratches the surface of your needs. These are what show up when your looking for information.

Less commercial search engines like duck-duck-go may not be as ad-driven in their search results, but they do not tailor results to your specific needs as a developer.

## how is noodle different?
noodle is a new paradigm in search. It leverages the power of similar searches of other developers who found solutions to the same problem - while maintaining anonymity and protecting private and proprietary data. The solutions are scored in terms of specificity to the version of language, sdks, level of expertise, and tools you are working with.

### local search
noodle is also a local search engine. It can index your projects, code repos, and search results - think "google desktop". But unlike google desktop, the information is stored locally, encrypted and protected. With local results, you can maintain a memory of past solutions without bookmarking. 

### collaborative context oriented search
Federated local machine learning allows noodle to anonymously search through the web search solutions of other solutions with the same context, prioritizing these results. This gives you a meta-search capability and leverages the searches of others, saving you time and finding relevant information much quicker. The information is relevant because the context is the same. I'll go into more detail about that later.

No more filtering through click-bait ad sites, or pages that contain your terms but not the context of the problem you are trying to solve.

### ads are a ding in the algorithm
Ad-based content will appear lower in the results. Why? Because the more ads a page has, the less relevant information it has. The creators of the page are working with google to capture as much traffic as possible. It's a win-win for google and the content generators. But it's a loss for you - a loss of time and energy. It's also a loss for the internet. 

We can reverse this process and restore the informational value of the internet by creating search engines that de-prioritize ad-based content. At the same time, we can find information faster, and maybe spend more time away from the computer or on hobbies. Think of the amount of time you can save as a developer with a decent search engine that prioritizes information content instead of ads, and takes into account the context of our search.

As developers, we owe it to ourselves to build this. You can do eet.

## open source? search is too hard
If search was so easy google wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar company - right?

Well... Think about when google arrived on the scene. alta-vista was the primary web-crawler and indexer. alta-vista returned millions of results but they were hardly relevant. Google was a huge improvement in terms of speed and relevance of results. 

But the bar was really low. I was a developer then, so I remember. Google just happened to be at the right place, at the right time. 

### is search really that hard?
Think about it. If you're an experienced web developer/engineer, could you write a basic search engine? I bet you could. 

Essentially a search engine is a crawler and an indexer. There are plenty of open-source examples for site-searches and intranets, and the tools for processing large data sets and matching information content with queries have improved significantly. 

### limiting scope - no porn
Limiting scope is also helpful. noodle is a search engine for finding technical answers. Therefore, no porn. That eliminates 80-90% of the internet. (If you want porn, use a different search engine)
